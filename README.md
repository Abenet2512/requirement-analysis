# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and is dedicated to understanding and applying Requirement Analysis in real-world software development.

The focus of this project is on documenting, analyzing, and structuring software requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It includes detailed insights into functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

The goal is to demonstrate how clear and well-structured requirement analysis contributes to the success of software projects.
