# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and is dedicated to understanding and applying Requirement Analysis in real-world software development.

The focus of this project is on documenting, analyzing, and structuring software requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It includes detailed insights into functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

The goal is to demonstrate how clear and well-structured requirement analysis contributes to the success of software projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project's needs are thoroughly gathered, analyzed, validated, and documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development, ensuring the final product meets user expectations and business goals.

During this phase, stakeholders‚Äîincluding clients, users, project managers, and developers‚Äîcollaborate to identify **what the system should do** (functional requirements) and **how it should perform** (non-functional requirements). The goal is to transform vague ideas and high-level objectives into clear, actionable requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- ‚úÖ **Defines the project scope**: Prevents scope creep by setting clear expectations.
- ‚úÖ **Ensures stakeholder alignment**: Helps all parties agree on what will be delivered.
- ‚úÖ **Guides design and**

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most crucial stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It lays the groundwork for building a solution that aligns with stakeholder needs and business goals. Below are three key reasons why Requirement Analysis is critical:

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Scope Creep
Clear and structured requirements reduce misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers. This helps prevent scope creep, where new features are added mid-project without proper planning, leading to delays and budget issues.

### 2. Provides a Clear Roadmap for Development
Well-defined requirements serve as a reference point for designers, developers, and testers. They help ensure that everyone understands what is expected, what needs to be built, and how the system should behave under various conditions.

### 3. Enhances Quality and User Satisfaction
By identifying and validating user needs early on, Requirement Analysis ensures the final product meets expectations. This reduces the number of revisions and increases user satisfaction, making the software more likely to succeed in real-world use.

Requirement Analysis ensures the development team builds the *right system*‚Äînot just a working one.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis consists of several structured activities that help in defining and refining the needs of stakeholders. Below are the five key activities involved:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  This involves collecting requirements from stakeholders using methods such as interviews, questionnaires, observations, and reviewing existing documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  This step focuses on extracting detailed requirements through brainstorming sessions, prototyping, use case analysis, and workshops to discover implicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  All gathered and elicited requirements are documented in clear, structured formats such as Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, or use case descriptions.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  In this phase, requirements are analyzed for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Visual models like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, and ER diagrams are created to represent the system.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Requirements are reviewed and confirmed with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect business needs. Validation techniques include walkthroughs, inspections, and formal reviews.

These activities ensure the development process starts on a solid, well-understood foundation.
## Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are categorized into two main types: Functional and Non-functional Requirements. Both are essential to define the system's behavior and performance expectations.

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system should do. They define the core functions and features that allow users and systems to interact.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for available properties based on location, dates, and amenities.
- Users can create an account and log in securely.
- Admins can add, update, or remove property listings.
- Users can book a property and make payments through integrated payment gateways.
- The system sends booking confirmation emails to users.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define how the system performs a task rather than what the task is. They focus on aspects like performance, security, scalability, and usability.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system must respond to search queries within 2 seconds.
- The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- All user data must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS, AES).
- The user interface must be mobile-responsive and accessible to users with disabilities.
- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime availability.

Clearly differentiating these two types of requirements ensures that both user expectations and technical performance standards are met during system development.
## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of a system‚Äôs functionality from the perspective of its users (actors). These diagrams help identify the various interactions users can have with the system, making it easier to define the system's scope and functional requirements.

### üîç Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Clarify system behavior through user interaction
- Help stakeholders understand system functionality easily
- Serve as a reference during design and development
- Identify primary and secondary system actors
- Provide a foundation for writing test cases

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are a set of predefined conditions that a product or feature must meet to be accepted by the user, customer, or stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story or feature and ensure that the development team understands what is required for the feature to be considered complete.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria:
- **Clarity:** Provides a clear understanding of the feature‚Äôs functionality and boundaries.
- **Verification:** Helps QA and developers know exactly what to test and build.
- **Alignment:** Ensures that all stakeholders are on the same page about expectations.
- **Prevents Scope Creep:** Defines ‚Äúdone,‚Äù minimizing misunderstandings and unnecessary additions.

### Example: Acceptance Criteria for ‚ÄúCheckout Feature‚Äù in Booking System

**User Story**: As a guest, I want to securely pay for a property booking so that I can confirm my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The user must be logged in to access the checkout page.
2. The booking summary (dates, price, property) must be displayed before payment.
3. The system must accept payments via credit/debit cards and PayPal.
4. The payment form must validate required fields before submission.
5. On successful payment, the booking status should change to ‚ÄúConfirmed.‚Äù
6. A confirmation email must be sent to the user with booking details.
