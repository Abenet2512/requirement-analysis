# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering program and is dedicated to understanding and applying Requirement Analysis in real-world software development.

The focus of this project is on documenting, analyzing, and structuring software requirements for a **Booking Management System**. It includes detailed insights into functional and non-functional requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria.

The goal is to demonstrate how clear and well-structured requirement analysis contributes to the success of software projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a fundamental phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the project's needs are thoroughly gathered, analyzed, validated, and documented. It serves as the foundation for all subsequent stages of development, ensuring the final product meets user expectations and business goals.

During this phase, stakeholders—including clients, users, project managers, and developers—collaborate to identify **what the system should do** (functional requirements) and **how it should perform** (non-functional requirements). The goal is to transform vague ideas and high-level objectives into clear, actionable requirements.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- ✅ **Defines the project scope**: Prevents scope creep by setting clear expectations.
- ✅ **Ensures stakeholder alignment**: Helps all parties agree on what will be delivered.
- ✅ **Guides design and**
